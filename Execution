# 🚀 Execution Guide: Face Liveness Detection using YOLOv8

This document provides a step-by-step guide to execute the entire pipeline of the Face Liveness Detection project using YOLOv8.

---

## 📋 Steps to Execute the Project

### 1. 📥 Clone or Download the Repository

Save a copy of this repository to your local system.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/face-liveness-detection-yolov8.git
cd face-liveness-detection-yolov8
```

---

### 2. 🎥 Collect Face Data

Run the `dataCollection.py` script to capture real and fake face images using your webcam.

```bash
python dataCollection.py
```

- Images will be saved in the `Dataset/` folder.
- Label faces as:
  - `1` for Real Faces
  - `0` for Fake Faces

📝 **Note**: Ensure good lighting and multiple samples for better model accuracy.

---

### 3. 🔀 Split the Dataset

Use `SplitData.py` to split the collected dataset into **Training**, **Validation**, and **Testing** sets.

```bash
python SplitData.py
```

This will organize your `Dataset/` into appropriate folders.

---

### 4. 📝 Create `data.yaml`

Manually create a `data.yaml` file in the root directory with the following content:

```yaml
train: Dataset/images/train
val: Dataset/images/val
test: Dataset/images/test

nc: 2
names: ['fake', 'real']
```

- `nc`: number of classes
- `names`: class labels

---

### 5. 🏋️ Train the YOLOv8 Model

Run the `train.py` script to train the model using the YOLOv8 architecture.

```bash
python train.py
```

After successful training, a `best.pt` model file will be generated in:

```
runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt
```

---

### 6. 📦 Move Trained Weights

Copy the `best.pt` file to your main working directory.

```bash
cp runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt .
```

Make sure `main.py` loads this model:

```python
model = YOLO("best.pt")
```

---

### 7. 🎯 Run Real-Time Detection

Execute `main.py` to launch the webcam and begin real-time face liveness classification.

```bash
python main.py
```

- The system will detect a face and classify it as **Real** or **Fake** on the screen.
- Press `q` to exit the webcam window.
